# LuckyPick
This HTML and JavaScript program creates an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors web game where the player competes against the computer. The interface displays three clickable buttons (each showing an image of rock, paper, or scissors). When the player clicks one, the playgame() function runs, randomly selecting a move for the computer through pickComputerMove() and determining the outcome—win, lose, or tie—based on the standard game rules. The result and both moves are shown dynamically on the page, and the running score (wins, losses, ties) is updated and displayed in real time. The score is also saved in the browser’s localStorage so it persists across sessions. A “Reset Score” button allows the player to clear all scores and start fresh. The layout is styled with CSS to give the buttons circular borders, dark background, and white text for visual contrast.
